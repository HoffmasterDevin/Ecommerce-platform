  ## Installation
  You must have Node.JS installed. Recommended version 16.19.0 or above. In your repository run `npm i` to install all required modules. Log into the MySQL Shell, and run the schema file using `source <route to schema.sql>` to create the database, and `npm run seed` if you would like prefilled data. Finally create a `.env` file  looking like the following:
  ```
  DB_NAME='staff_db'
  DB_USER='your_username' 
  DB_PW='your_pass'
  ```
  ## Usage
  Run `npm start` to start the server. Using an API tool, make API calls using the routes found in the routes folder to manipulate data.
